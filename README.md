# DeepLearning
This repository contains my hands-on practice of core deep learning concepts using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It includes implementations of neural networks, activation functions, backpropagation, CNNs, RNNs, and model training experiments to strengthen practical skills and build a strong AI/ML foundation.
